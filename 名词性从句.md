## 名词性从句
+ 名词在句子中能够充当的成分，名词从句都可以充当，故分为**四类**
  + 主语从句
    > What I saw looks terrific.
  + 宾语从句
    > I admine what she said.
  + 表语从句
    > Gump is who we should learn from.
  + 同位语从句
    > I enjoy the part that a bird is flying.
+ 引导词的分类
  - 名词性从句的引导词是按照从句的类型分的类，共分为三类，并且英语中所有的从句都是陈述句的形式，也就是 “ 引导词 + 主语 + 谓语 “ 的形式
    1. **" that "**：当从句是**陈述句**时，并且 " that " 在从句中不充当任何成分也没有任何意思
       > That he has got divorced is my fault.

       > That ladies tend to be right,remains common knowledge.
    2. **" whether "**：当从句是**一般疑问句**（可用 yes / no 回答）时，并且 " whether " 在从句中不充当任何成分，译为“是否”
       + 问句中有be动词
         > Is he happy? => Whether he is happy
       + 问句中有一般助动词(can、will、may、should、must、have、ought to)
         > Can he do it? => Whether he can do it
         
         > Has he done it? => Whether he has done it
       + 问句中有do、does、did等助动词
         > Did he come? => Whether he came
         
         > Does he like it? => Whether he likes it        
         
    3. **特殊疑问词**：当从句是特殊疑问句时
       + 问句中有be动词
         > What is he doing? => What he is doing
       + 问句中有一般助动词
         > Where can he find? => Where he can find it
       + 问句中有do、does、did等助动词
         > What did he write? => What he wrote

         > Who came here? => Who came here
### 考点分析
+ **主语从句**
  - 名词性从句做主语易造成主语太长的现象，故把主语从句首放到句末，加 **" it "** 于句首来做**形式主语**
  - 满分句型：
    - It ... that ...
    - It is apparent that ...
    - It looks beyond dispute that ... 
    - It keeps my argument that ...
    - It is universally acknowledged that ...
  > It looks beyond dispute that the issue about diligence has been brought into the limelight. 
+ **宾语从句**
  - 只要实意动词后面有个引导词就暂定为宾语从句(此处未考虑状语从句)。
    > He died **when he saw me**. 状语从句

    > She said(that) she would marry an old rich man. (只有宾语从句中的 " that "可以省略)
+ **表语从句**
  - 只要系动词的后面有引导词
  > A report consistently brought back by visitorws to the US is how friendly,courteous and helofulmost Americans were to them.
+ **同位语从句**
  - 同位语从句既可以放在他所解释的名词后，也可以放到整句话的后面。
  > The matter that he managed to find a girlfriend makes his superiors rejoiced.  
  
  > Nothing can hide the truth that she is getting old.
  
  > The outlook proves wrong that private individuals in HK seem all deceivers
